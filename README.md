# Unity-Engine-Project
A personal project built using C# and Unity Engine. Development logs and demo videos can be found at: https://www.anthonywkma.com/programming/unity-project.html

This repository stores the C# code base which iteracts with Unity Engine. Technical note: Variables which have been declared with no initial value are either defined in subclasses, or within Unity Engine's public field inspectors.
